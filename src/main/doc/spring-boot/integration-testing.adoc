== Integration Testing

The example includes a https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/tree/master/components/fabric8-arquillian[fabric8 arquillian] Kubernetes Integration Test.
Once the container image has been built and deployed in Kubernetes, the integration test can be run with:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn test -Dtest=*KT
----

The test is disabled by default and has to be enabled using `-Dtest`. https://fabric8.io/guide/testing.html[Integration Testing] and https://fabric8.io/guide/arquillian.html[Fabric8 Arquillian Extension] provide more information on writing full fledged black box integration tests for Kubernetes.
